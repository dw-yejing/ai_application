# FR Loss on Mnist
Implement diffrent Face Recognition Loss with Pytorch. Testing and visualizing on Mnist. It's just a toy example but very useful to understand and compare those loss function.

## Recent Updata
**`2020.1.14`**: 
- Fix some bugs in ArcFace
- Visualize test data rather than training data
- Add support for our QAMFace Loss

## Example

## Quick Start
### Dependencies
- Pytorch >=1.0 (0.4 maybe work either)
- tensorboardX >=1.4

I highly recommend you to use Anaconda.
### How to run
- Net.py include the implementation of network and loss functions
- train.py contains the training and test process. Editing name to choose a proper loss function.

## About the project
- I try to use the same structure to implement different loss. If you have any questions or you find any mistakes, please submmit an issue. Thanks a lot!
